|| *Name* || Shuffl ||
|| *Description* || Shuffl is an experimental system for small-scale data curation and web-publication  ||
|| *URI* ||  http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/ ||
|| *Governance Model* || Shuffl presently has a benevolent dictatorship governance model headed by Graham Klyne.  Graham is the project manager and currently part-time funded to run this project to November 2009.  The project will engage with researchers who have indicated support for its goals, and will seek to use their experience to guide the project's direction. During this initially funded, it is anticipated that additional volunteer input may be minimal, though user feedback, bug reports, patches and more will be gratefully accepted (and duly acknowledged).  <br/><br/> Beyond the initially funded phase, we hope to use the established functionality to draw in a wider community, and review governance procedures accordingly. ||
|| *Motivating factors* || Shuffl is initially aimed at small-scale research teams, particularly life-science lab researchers, though we hope it eventually can be used by a far wider community.  As noted, we will engage with these users to guide the choice of functionality developed, wishing to creating a product that *is* useful to someone today than potentially useful to everyone tomorrow. ||
