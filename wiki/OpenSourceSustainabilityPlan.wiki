#summary Plan for open source and sustainability aspects of project

(TODO: discuss this with OSS-watch, especially the section [#Summary_thoughts_on_sustainability Summary thoughts on sustainability])

= Introduction =

This page documents a plan for creating an open source project that is sustainable as such beyond the initial funding period.  It draws upon advice from OSS-Watch, particularly the page at http://wiki.oss-watch.ac.uk/StartYourProject.

= Identify community =

This project has arisen from previous work that aims to facilitate the publication of research data on the web, so that it can be reviewed, and re-used in the generation of new insights, and to avoid the costs of unnecessary repeated experimentation.  This has involved a combination of biological researchers, classical arts researchers, and semantic web experts.

User community: initially, small research teams, particularly in life-sciences and classical arts;  later, almost anyone who uses a computer to gather, organize and disseminate data.

Developer community: initially, me and maybe some close colleagues; later, semantic web developers, academic software developers, and hopefully more.

= Source code licence =

The MIT licence has been chosen as it is simple and permissive.  I believe sustainability for this project is maximized by lowering the barriers to adoption or adaptation, even if that means some users may "free-ride".  Experience suggests that most will not.

= Collaborative decision making =

The project welcomes contributions from anyone who has an interest in its goals, and explicitly aims to encourage participation.  This decision making (or "governance") model aims to indicate to potential contributors the ways in which they may engage with the project. 

In the style of the examples at http://wiki.oss-watch.ac.uk/ExamplesOfOpenSourceGovernanceModels

|| *Name* || Shuffl ||
|| *Description* || Shuffl is an experimental system for small-scale data curation and web-publication  ||
|| *URI* ||  http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/ ||
|| *Governance Model* || Shuffl presently has a "meritocracy of one" governance model led by Graham Klyne.  Graham is the project manager and currently part-time funded to run this project to November 2009.  The project will actively engage with researchers who have indicated support for its goals, and will seek to use their experience to guide the project's early directions. During this initially funded pase user feedback, bug reports, patches and more will be gratefully accepted (and duly acknowledged).  <br/><br/> Beyond the initially funded phase, we hope to use the established functionality to draw in a wider community to the recognized meritocracy. ||
|| *Motivating factors* || Shuffl is initially aimed at small-scale research teams, particularly life-science lab researchers, though we hope it eventually can be used by a far wider community.  As noted, we will engage with these users to guide the choice of functionality developed, wishing to creating a product that *is* useful to someone today than potentially useful to everyone tomorrow. ||
|| *Links* || TODO;  link for meritocracy governance model.   <br/><br/> (as opposed to: http://wiki.oss-watch.ac.uk/BenevolentDictatorGovernanceModel) ||

= Community tools =

== Tools for communications ==

Intended tools for communication are:
 * the Google code project wiki (http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/w/list)
 * a Google groups mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/shuffl-discuss)
 * articles tagged 'jiscri' and 'shuffl' in a personal blog (http://signal-and-noise.blogspot.com/)

The mailing list is open for anyone to view, but posts from non-members will be held for moderation. (If spam proves to be a problem, membership may be required for posting messages.)  Membership is subject to moderation.  The aim is to be as open as possible while minimizing the impact of spam messages.

Other tools to be considered in future:
 * Screencasts

(TODO: Description of a Project (DOAP) record)

== Version management ==

Subversion provided through a Google code project.

== Issue tracking ==

Issue tracking provided buy Google code.

== Project management ==

The key style here is lightweight.  Which is not to say non-existent.  My experience is that 10-15% project time spent on planning is well-spent in ensuring that the remainder of the time is used effectively.

The intended style of development management is based on agile methods, though not using a specific agile methodology.  Initially, the Google Code wiki will be used to collect information about the project roadmap, user stories, task breakdown and sprint plans.  Later, we hope that Shuffl itself will be able to provide some of the development management tooling, in a fashion similar to Mingle.

The management processes and tool usage will be subject to continuous review and re-evaluation.  Getting the job done trumps consistency.  See [#Agile_ecosystem Agile ecosystem] below.

== Contributor licence agreement ==

See: http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla.xml

(TODO: I'm hoping for a form of agreement to be provided by OSS-watch, following a "distributed ownership model")

= Subversion repository organization =

Top-level branch and tag directories, with sub-projects having separate subdirectories under trunk.  (This facilitates relative file references between sub-projects, which in turn facilitate building or using the software in different environments.) 

Within a single Google code project, this organization is pretty much dictated in any case.

= Release management =

See http://wiki.oss-watch.ac.uk/Release_Management

(TODO: outline release management process)

= Agile ecosystem =

(TODO: find IBRG notes)


= Sustainability options =

The clear message from the second link above is that the project will need some level of continuing input (if not income) to survive.

Possible sources of future inputs include:
 * Further JISC-funded projects:  JISC are very clear that they won't fund continuing development of jiscri projects such as this, but does not explicitly rule out further projects that build upon the facilities provided by such a project.  Indeed, the emphasis in the JISC call for building upon exiting work, JISC-funded or otherwise, suggests this would be viewed favourably as long as genuinely new functionality is being created.  Shuffl is intended to be a minimal, flexible platform for small-scale data curation and management, and we anticipate many opportunities to build it out in different ways (Google Wave integration and video annotation are just two possibilities I have thought about in the past week or so).
 * Future non-JISC funded projects: I have hopes that if we can make something that our research users actually like and use, ourselves or other developers have a basis for requesting further funds from research councils and other bodies to build new capabilities that further enhance the researchers' work.
 * Volunteer efforts: other developers choosing to donate development and/or documentation effort.
 * Support from a commercial organization (including a possible commercial spin-off).

The conduct of Shuffl is intended to be fully open from the outset.  All technical, managerial and operational decisions will be recorded here, alongside the open source code and documentation.  This should help to ensure that well-motivated newcomers can learn enough about the project to make useful contributions.

== Infrastructure Costs ==

Using Google-hosted services means the project infrastructure's existence is not subject to the vagaries of research project funding.  The persistent fabric of the project will be able to survive funding gaps, as long as Google continues to provide these services for free (and they do appear to have some commercial motivation to do so).

== Support costs ==

The costs of responding to users' and developers' questions.  Being able to do this will always require some degree of resource input.

Provide an environment that allows a community to support themselves - the Google infrastructure helps here.

Support costs for the product produced by the projects initial phase may be reduced by ensuring adequate documentation and support materials are created while the project is funded.

Support costs for the project itself (the ongoing community of users and developers) may be reduced is a suitably modular software architecture is adopted; i.e. requested changes to the system can be implemented through add-in modules rather than changes to the core system.  jQuery's established plug-in framework might be something that can help here.  The storage back-end should be abstracted, so it can be replaced at will by something that plays well in an intended deployment environment.

== Collaboration and consensus costs ==

These costs may be the hardest to defray:  formal control of a project's direction and integrity needs a committed team or individual, who usually need to have an income from somewhere to support their activity.  If the overhead of governance is low, then a single volunteer may be able to hold down the job, but this would not be a scalable solution.

If the project is wildly successful, then it maybe can come under the wing of one of the established organizations (Apache, etc.) and use their governance structures.

If the project has some commercial appeal, then maybe a company would be prepared to provide cover for this function, possibly in return for access to a skilled individual.

== Development costs ==

All the factors affecting support costs and governance costs apply, but there are some aspects of development costs that can be mitigated though the technical approach to the product:
 * Make as much use of existing open source frameworks and projects as possible, thereby benefiting from their sustainability
 * A framework that can be extended very easily to provide new user benefits is more likely to attract volunteer developer effort, maybe even from user/developers.

The bottom line here would appear to be:  try to avoid making expensive and constraining commitments in the software's technical design. (Maybe easier said than done, but worth trying for.)

== Summary thoughts on sustainability ==

(TODO: replace this with something more positive, when I know what.  OSS-Watch, can you help here?)

[http://wiki.oss-watch.ac.uk/SustainableOpenSource OSS-Watch says] (section 1, para 4) that many OS projects fail because they don't plan for success, but I'm finding it hard to understand what success might look like and what form it would take, so cannot see how to really plan for it.

The only party of this analysis that feels at all satisfactory is the infrastructure sustainability.  In theface of all other uncertainties, Googles continuing infastructure support feels rock-solid.

I can see that the project may be sustainable if it succeeds in just a small way, with low-overhead governance, a self-supporting community and ad-hoc ongoing development.  I can also see how a project would be sustainable through attracting substantial support from further research grants or commercial interests if it is wildly successful.  But the transition from small-scale to large-scale success is hard to plot, and I fail to see how to plan for it other than to understand the needs and make a conscious attempt to be flexible and opportunistic.

Going though the exercise of preparing this plan, the one thing that I can see doing from the outset is being more conscious of the need to make it as easy as possible for users and developers to join in, though small as well as large contributions, and that this is something that pervades all other aspects of the project, right down to technical design issues.
