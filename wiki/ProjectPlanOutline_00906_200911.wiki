#summary TODO: Project plan outline for initial phase June 2009 to November 2009

= Introduction =

 * JISC project proposal: http://shuffl.googlecode.com/files/20090421-shuffl-proposal-no-budget-figures.pdf

= Effort schedule =

Nominally, the Shuffl project funds 60% of my time from mid-June to the end of
November, a total of 73 days of work.  This will run in parallel with the Claros project which funds my time at 20% for the same period.  Under the circumstances, we probably don't want to immediately reduce my Claros
effort, and it would be good to have more time devoted to Shuffl in the later stages of the project.

Thus, this is the effort allocation that is planned for the next few months:

= Outline plan from proposal =

|| Month || Activity || Deliverables || 
|| 1 || Initial planning. Project || Setup, and further discussion with JISC OSS-Watch about open source tooling, licensing and governance issues. Prototype user interface in Javascript. Project plan. Publicly hosted source and project tracking facility. Interface prototype that can be shown to users to elicit feedback and further requirements. ||
|| 2 || Develop supporting back-end service, and canvass potential users for feedback on initial interface - identification of a minimum system that target users would actually use for some purpose, however trivial. || Initial front-to-back system. Basic user documentation. A "hit list" of desired features. ||
|| 3 || Enhancements to system; capturing structure in data; basic user authentication and access control. Use of system for project tasks. Seminar/demonstrations to solicit users and feedback. || Updated system. Examples of system in use. Updated feature list. ||
|| 4 || Further enhancements. External linking and data integration. Continued user engagement. || Updated system, more examples of system in use. Updated feature list. Initial community web page describing the system and applications. ||
|| 5 || Create promotional materials (webcast, dissemination, demonstrations, etc.). Establish a long-term home for the demo service. Ensure that users with whom we have engaged are comfortable with what is available as this project winds down. || Public repository contains fully tested software, documentation, promotional materials, deployment instructions, examples, etc., in a state suitable to support ongoing open community development. ||
