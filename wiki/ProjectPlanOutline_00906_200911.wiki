#summary TODO: Project plan outline for initial phase June 2009 to November 2009

= Introduction =

 * JISC project proposal: http://shuffl.googlecode.com/files/20090421-shuffl-proposal-no-budget-figures.pdf

= Effort schedule =

Nominally, the Shuffl project funds 60% of my time from mid-June to the end of
November, a total of 73 days of work.  This will run in parallel with the Claros project which funds my time at 20% for the same period.  Under the circumstances, we probably don't want to immediately reduce my Claros
effort, and it would be good to have more time devoted to Shuffl in the later stages of the project.

Thus, this is the effort allocation that is planned for the next few months:
