#summary Sprint 7 plan : 2 Nov - 13 Nov

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

This sprint will be a continuation of the previous sprint's data visualization work.  The focus will be making it relatively easy to create useful graphical displays from Chris Holland's data.  A number of details that need addressing are now coming apparent that were not allowed for in the original plan, mainly centred around the user interface and usability.  These additional details arise to a large extent as a result of the change of early focus to visualization rather than collection of data.

Software is not yet in a state to consider final packaging and documentation as envisaged by the original outline plan (see below).  Before the end of this or the final sprint, I really need to ensure that the sustainability plan has been wrapped up (as far as I can), and the CLA is in place so that development can continue in partnership with other projects.  (Despite possibly achieving less than a fully deployable application, I feel that a very useful platform has been created for continuing useful work, and that the original goals remain viable and attainable with further effort, which will be forthcoming as part of the ADMIRAL project.)

== Current milestone ==

|| Month || Activity || Deliverables || 
|| 5: 27Nov 16days || Create promotional materials (webcast, dissemination, demonstrations, etc.). Establish a long-term home for the demo service. Ensure that users with whom we have engaged are comfortable with what is available as this project winds down. || Public repository contains fully tested software, documentation, promotional materials, deployment instructions, examples, etc., in a state suitable to support ongoing open community development. ||

= Task breakdowns =

(effort estimates in days to nearest 0.25)

== 3.2: Revised data import/visualization ==

Estimated effort: 3.5 days

 * (1.0) add column status selectors (none, x1, y1, y2) and link to output data (*Done* 06-Nov-2009)
 * (0.5) add scale axis transformation options  (*Done* 06-Nov-2009)
 * (0.5) save card data linkage in serialization of workspace (*Done* 03-Nov-2009)
 * (0.5) implement user-editable labels and link to output (*Deferred*)
 * (1.0) add colour selection and link to output data (*Deferred*)

Actual effort: 2.9 days (for 2.0 planned activity)

== 3.3: Improve I/O error handling ==

The main goal of this task is to prevent I/O errors on workspace load (e.g. non-existent files) from completely locking up further Shuffl I/O.

Estimated effort: 1.0 days

 * (0.25) complete new error reporting functions (*Done* 11-Nov-2009/0.2)
 * (0.25) revise existing code to use new error reporting function (*Done* 11-Nov-2009/0.2)
 * (0.5) review workspace load/save code to catch I/O errors, report them and take appropriate recovery steps (*Done* 12-Nov-2009/0.6)

Actual effort: 1.0 days (for 1.0 planned activity)

== 3.4: User interface for load/save workspace ==

This task will be progressed but probably not completed within this sprint.

Estimated effort: 5.0 days

 * (0.5) implement generic read-only interface plugin for local files
 * (1.0) implement generic interface plugin for !AtomPub
 * (1.0) implemented simplified load/save user interface using back-end plugin features
 * (0.5) investigate Google data interface
 * (2.0) implement generic interface plugin for Google Data

Actual effort: 0.9 days (for 0 planned activity)

= Sprint review notes =

First week:  most of the effort has been spent working on the user interface for graph display, which feels like a distraction from the main target.  I guess this is the price of taking the visualization route for engaging researchers.  I can't compete with Excel here. Even with the magic of jQuery, UI development is still very time consuming, dealing with the many minutiae that are needed for even rudimentary usability.  Label editing and colour selection are still outstanding, but I think I've done enough for now, at least until I can speak again with Chris.  

The data visualization was deemed complete on 11 Nov 2009, when Chris Holland agreed that the outstanding sub-tasks were not an immediate priority.

Started work on improving I/O interface by attacking the I/O interface.  Started creating a framework to test and implement the revised API worked out in a previous sprint.  The basic test framework and basic structure is in place, and work has started on the local file system implementation, but none of the identified sub-tasks are actually complete.

== End-of-sprint review ==

The revised data visualization facilities were received very well.  The mechanisms for working directly with spreadsheet data went some way to reducing the pressure for some of the features not yet implemented.  I have agreed with Chris Holland to install a copy of Shuffl on a system where he can use it directly with his own data, which will hopefully provide a powerful point of engagement for continuing work on the ADMIRAL project.

== Velocity ==

Tasks completed/effort spent: 3.75/7.9 = 0.51

(Completed work excludes task 1.4, which is "non-productive" overhead)

The lower-than-usual velocity this sprint reflects a high load of misc admin activity, and effort spent productively on  task 3.4 has not yet resulted in completion of any identified goal.)
