== Title of Primary Project Output ==

Shuffl: web-bases system for small scale data visualization and annotation

== Screenshots or diagram of prototype ==

== Description of Prototype ==

The prototype demonstrates the Shuffl framework, which allows new "cards" to be created by dragging and dropping from "stockpiles" at the top of the workspace, and changed in the workspace by double-clicking on text to be edited. Specific card types implemented so far include:
 * a simple text annotation card, for recording free-text notes
 * a data table card, which uses AJAX calls to read CSV data from a web location or file system (subject to the same origin restriction), display this as a table in the card, and provides for selection of data to be visualized.
 * a graph plotting card, an example of one way that data may be visualized.  Data for graphing is indicated by dragging a data table card and dropping it onto the graph card.

When loaded from an eXist !AtomPub server, the demonstrator also shows how workspaces can be saved and loaded by selecting options from the workspace menu (which is activated by clicking on the "Shuffl" logo at the top of the workspace.

This demonstrator software has focused on the the underlying Shuffl framework and the data visualization framework.  Desired features that are not yet implemented include:
 * file system browser for loading and saving workspaces
 * card collections and card relationships structured as collections (e.g. as hierarchies)
 * support for Google Data and WebDAV back-ends
 * image gallery and image annotation
 * saving data as RDF (currently, Shuffl uses JSON, as that was quicker and easier to get working).
(Many of these features will be tackled as part of the forthcoming ADMIRAL project.)

Work has also been done, but not shown in the demonstrator, to prove that independently-developed widgets that access information from other web resources and services can be embedded in Shuffl cards (Wookie widgets and FlyWeb gene finder).

== Link to working prototype ==

These demonstration prototypes run directly from the Google Code subversion repository:
 * http://shuffl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/static/demo/shuffl-demo.xhtml (with initially empty workspace)
 * http://shuffl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/static/demo/shuffl-demo-notes.xhtml (with notes about how to execute demonstration)

Screencast (just over 6 mins;  to paraphrase Blaise Pascal and others [1], _I made this demonstration longer than asked because I lack the time to make it shorter_):

== Link to end user documentation ==

End-user documentation for Shuffl is rather thin on the ground, but I did prepare these:

 * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/ (brief introduction)
 * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/wiki/Shuffl_Demonstration (instructions for demonstrator)
 * http://shuffl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/static/docs/shuffl-intro.xhtml (a brief introduction presented using Shuffl itself) 

Not so much end-user documentation, but project management notes and design notes are recorded in the project wiki:
 * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/w/list

== Link to code repository or API ==

 * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/source/checkout (page with details for Subversion checkout of source)
 * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/source/browse/#svn/trunk (source code browser)
 * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src (browse main source code libraries for Shuffl itself)

== Link to technical documentation ==

 * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/w/list (project management notes and technical design notes are recorded here)
 * Detailed code and API documentation is provided through source code comments:
    * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src (to browse main Javascript source code)
 * Unit test code provides a key element of API usage documentation:
    * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src/test (to browse unit test source code)
    * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/source/browse/#svn/trunk/static/test (to browse web pages used to run the unit tests)
    * http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/source/browse/#svn/trunk/static/test/data (supporting data for unit tests)

== Date prototype was launched ==

 * Initial launch at this location: 18-Nov-2009
 * Most recent launch: 30-Nov-2009

The demonstrator runs straight out of the Google Code subversion repository, and is frequently updated without formal launch procedures.  Earlier versions have been available since soon after the start of serious development work.
