#summary Sprint 6 plan : 19 Oct - 30 Oct

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

The main targets for this sprint will be to work towards improved usability in two areas:
 * Visualization of data: after demonstrating the data graphing interface to Chris Holland, I hope to find out what he _really_ wants, and to get some representative sample data from him.
 * Improve usability of the interface for importing data and loading/saving workspaces.

== Current milestone ==

|| Month || Activity || Deliverables || 
|| 4: 30Oct 16days || Further enhancements. External linking and data integration. Continued user engagement. || Updated system, more examples of system in use. Updated feature list. Initial community web page describing the system and applications. ||

== Current sprint ==

|| Sprint 6 || 19 Oct - 30 Oct || 8 days ||

(effort estimates in days to nearest 0.25)

== 3.2: Revised data import/visualization ==

Estimated effort: 4.0 days

 * Agree next-steps with Chris Holland (task 2.2) - focus on data selection from table cards
 * Finalize design of graphing card interface (*Done*)
 * (0.25) Remove filename/read option from graphing card
 * (0.25) Subscribe graph card to changes in data table card
 * (0.25) remove "read CSV" button from table card, re-read data whenever filename is changed, provide user feedback when data is updated.
 * (0.5) implement label-row selection and link to output
 * (0.5) implement data-rows selection and link to output
 * (0.25) Implement user-editable labels and link to output
 * (1.0) add row of column status selectors (none, x1, x2, y1, y2) and link to output data
 * (1.0) add colour selection and link to output data

Actual effort: ?? days (for ?? planned activity)

== 3.3: User interface for load/save workspace ==

This task will be started but probably not completed within this sprint.
It may be reviewed in light of the planned meeting with Chris Holland.

Estimated effort: 6.0 days

 * (0.5) review requirements for generic back-end interface (*Done* 19-Oct-2009)
 * (0.5) design generic back-end and plugin interface (*Done* 19-Oct-2009)
 * (0.5) implement generic read-only interface plugin for local files
 * (1.0) implement generic interface plugin for AtomPub
 * (1.0) implemented simplified load/save user interface using back-end plugin features
 * (0.5) investigate Google data interface
 * (2.0) implement generic interface plugin for Google Data

Actual effort: ?? days (for ?? planned activity)

== 3.4: Improve I/O error handling ==

The main goal of this task is to prevent I/O errors on workspace load (e.g. non-existent files) from completely locking up further Shuffl I/O.

Estimated effort: 1.0 days

 * (0.25) complete new error reporting functions
 * (0.25) revise existing code to use new error reporting function
 * (0.5) review workspace load/save code to catch I/O errors, report them and take appropriate recovery steps

Actual effort: ?? days (for ?? planned activity)

= Sprint review notes =

Following the meeting with Chris Holland, the first user function to tackle next will be data selection from data table cards - see the [http://code.google.com/p/shuffl/wiki/20091020_Chris_Holland meeting notes] for more details.

Task 3.2 remains a priority.  Usability and error handling issues also remain important to address.
