#summary Notes and ideas for future applications using Shuffl

= Introduction =

These are notes for possible future developments, not forming part of the current active project

= Google Wave integration =

Embed a Shuffl workspace in a Wave.

Embed a Wave in a Shuffl card.

Embed exported Shuffl data in a Wave =

= Video annotation =

Embed VLC browser-based player in a card

Provide UI for stop/start/location control of video

Event passing framework to synchronize multiple instances


= OpenCitationNetwork =

 * references are a pain point for researchers
 * many specialized systems (Endnote, Connotea, Zotero, ...)
 * but references don't exist in isolation - they *refer* to real things!  Reference management shouldn't be completely isolated from those things.
 * want to find ways of accessing, sharing and analyzing references and their relationships

OPEN UP THE CITATION INFORMATION:
 * near-term value: relieve (or share) some of the pain
 * long term value: expose paths to new knowledge, etc...
 * use RDF, with vocabulary (Cito), and open publication like FOAF
 * link to existing systems and expose content as RDF/Cito
 * gives Cito an immediate purpose
 * augment, don't compete with existing systems:  unlock their content, don't try to displace it.
 * add tooling to support linkage to other real-world entities (e.g. Shuffl?)

= Other =

 * Synchronize with mobile device notes !!!
 * More generally, card as unit of synchronization / update

Tagging - namespaces - ontologies:
 * bare tags, strictly local, no global semantics
 * prefixed tags, default based on local URI, may be overridden by PREFIX declaration to use global namespace
