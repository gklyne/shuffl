David Shotton suggested some links from his Amsterdam meeting that seemed to have some bearing on Shuffl:
 * http://technologies.kmi.open.ac.uk/cohere/ - references work that may offer be some ideas for visualization of Shuffl decks?
 * http://kmi.open.ac.uk/publications/pdf/kmi-04-29.pdf - talks about "information bricks" - maybe analogous to Shuffl's use of record cards?
