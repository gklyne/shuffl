Also, I thought I'd mention that I've been looking at the atom
publishing protocol. I also found that the eXist XML database supports
atompub out of the box [1]. I deployed eXist 1.2 as a war to tomcat,
and I had an atom server running with no coding or configuration. You
can then store/update/delete what is effectively arbitrary XML
content. It might be a quick option for you to get up and running with
your shuffl demo -- you could design a simple XML format for the card
data based on the atom syndication format, use atompub as the protocol
for managing the data, and use an OTS atom server for implementation.

As an aside, I also note that the google data apis [2] are all based
on extensions to atompub. I haven't looked at them in detail, but
might provide some best practice on how to extend atompub.
