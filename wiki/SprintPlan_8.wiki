#summary Sprint 8 plan : 16 Nov - 27 Nov

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

The main goals for this sprint are:
 * to complete the back-end storage interface work started in the previous sprint
 * to improve the online prototype demonstrator for project evaluation (mainly, create a new Shuffl workspace with instructions displayed for doing the various things that Shuffl can do.)  Also, notes for installing eXist and Shuffl on a new system
 * If possible, install a copy of Shuffl and eXist on a machine in CH's workgroup
 * final reporting and project wrap-up


== Current milestone ==

|| Month || Activity || Deliverables || 
|| 5: 27Nov 16days || Create promotional materials (webcast, dissemination, demonstrations, etc.). Establish a long-term home for the demo service. Ensure that users with whom we have engaged are comfortable with what is available as this project winds down. || Public repository contains fully tested software, documentation, promotional materials, deployment instructions, examples, etc., in a state suitable to support ongoing open community development. ||

= Task breakdowns =

(effort estimates in days to nearest 0.25)


== 3.2: Pluggable storage framework ==

Implementation to be sufficient to pass the current load/save test suite.

Estimated effort: 2.5 days

 * (0.5) implement generic read-only interface plugin for local files (*Done* 16-Nov-2009/0.5)
 * (1.0) implement generic interface plugin for eXist !AtomPub (*Done* 17-Nov-2009/0.8)
 * (0.5) update load workspace module to use the revised framework
 * (0.5) update save workspace module to use the revised framework

Actual effort: ?? days (for ?? planned activity)

== 3.3: Load/save workspace user interface improvement ==

Estimated effort: 1.0 days

 * (0.5) Implement simplified load/save user interface with dialogs, using the pluggable storage interface and presenting a single workspace URI rather than 3 fields,
 * (0.5) Work through and replace all direct references to AtomPub module, except those in the eXist pluggable storage module.

Actual effort: ?? days (for ?? planned activity)

== 3.4: User interface for workspace browsing ==

Estimated effort: 3.0 days

 * (0.25) check service document handling in eXist 1.4
 * (0.25) investigate Google Data API for loading/saving workspaces
 * (0.5) plan strategy to implement collection/workspace browsing via eXist
 * (1.0) implement browsing capability in eXist storage plug-in module
 * (1.0) add browse facility to load/save dialogs

Actual effort: ?? days (for ?? planned activity)


= Sprint review notes =

(TBD)

== End-of-sprint review ==

(As this is the last sprint - focus on outputs for demonstration and other projects.)

== Velocity ==

Tasks completed/effort spent: ??/?? = ??

(Completed work excludes task 1.4, which is "non-productive" overhead)
