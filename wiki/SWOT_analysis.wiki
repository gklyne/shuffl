= Introduction =

This page is a work-in-progress.

Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats will be recorded as they arise or are noticed.

= Strengths =

 * Simple, adaptable underlying structure; it has been easy to see how unanticipated user requests
 * Most potential users respond quickly and positively to the basic UI ideas

= Weaknesses =

 * Browser portability problems (focusing on Firefox and Safari for now)
 * Impediments of browser "same origin" restriction for Ajax calls

= Opportunities =

 * Plug-in architecture allows framework to grow in response to new requirements
 * Possible framework for rapid UI development for other web applications (e.g. Simal use-case).

= Threats =

 * Failure to achieve stable underlying platform
 * Problems with access to persistent storage (e.g. fragility of !AtomPub handler)
 * Failure to fully engage with end users to the extent that they will actually use the system
 * Failure to package the system in a way that meets user expectations for usability; this relates to persistent storage access problems
