In order to confirm the rights granted in connection with the Contribution (as defined below) , the University must receive a signed Agreement from each Contributor.  This Agreement is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the University and the Project users; it does not prevent you from using your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party licence or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) associated with any part of Your Contributions.
