#summary TODO: User stories for development

= Introduction =

This page lists user stories that are used to guide the development of new functionality.

The general structure used here is:

<blockquote>
*As a* _stakeholder_, *I want* _some capability_, *so that* _some benefit_
</blockquote>

which serves to link the requirements to identifiable end-user benefits.  These user stories are the link between end-user requirements and development targets.
