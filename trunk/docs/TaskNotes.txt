#summary Notes for tasks to be tackled

Project admin:
 * Start building user stories and requirements

Code! 
 * Construct cards from data - design data, load it, function to construct card (standard format)
 * Card content editing
 * Local save / cut-paste of layout+card data
 * Card type plug-in structure (see modularization)
 * More comprehensive template / card construction functions
 * Think about testing - focus on data handling here
 * Modularization (see wiki notes): also a good time to think about testing
 * Refactor CSS styles for cards, to focus on a smaller set of basic styles for id, title, body, tags, etc.
 * Edit / undo buffer?
