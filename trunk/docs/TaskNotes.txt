#summary Notes for tasks to be tackled

Project admin:
 * Initial sprint plan
 * Start building user stories and requirements

Code! 
 * Construct cards from data - design data, load it, function to construct card (standard format)
 * Window resizing and card containment (?)
 * More comprehensive template / card construction functions
 * Think about testing - focus on data handling here

Using the Tabulator RDF parser - see:
 * http://brondsema.net/blog/index.php/2006/11/25/javascript_rdfparser_from_tabulator
 * http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/149 (is this the same parser? I think not.)
 * in terms.js, RDFFormula provides a store for RDF data.  
   There is a simpler one in /Users/graham/workspace/tabulator/test/rdf/rdfparser.test.html:
   maybe use this interface to create a wrapper for the rdfquery store?
 * The test store also uses something called XMLSerializer for dealing with XML literals.
 * For Notation3, look for SinkParser (!)
