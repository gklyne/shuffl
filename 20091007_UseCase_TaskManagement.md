# Summary #

Use-case suggested by David Shotton

  * Effort  - small / moderate / larse (e.g. <day ~day >day
  * Importance - useful / important / critical
  * Immediacy (urgency) - future / pressing / urgent  (... + overdue?)

Note: just 3 values in each dimension, keeps interface simple

  * Deadline, + missable / desirable / absolute; allows immediacy to be updated automatically by reference to current date.

Each task is captured on a card, and Shuffl chooses display attributes and position for each card that make it easy to see what tasks are candidates for doing next.

_GK thought:  blocked tasks?_

_GK thought: could this be worked into agile story/task cards?_
